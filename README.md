# Stock Price Prediction
Final project for the Building AI course

## Introduction to Stock Price prediction
Stock price prediction is a crucial aspect of financial markets, aiming to forecast the future prices of stocks. Accurate predictions can help investors make informed decisions, potentially leading to profitable investments. The process involves analyzing historical data, market trends, and various external factors that might influence stock prices.

## Key Concepts and Techniques

1. Time Series Analysis:
      * ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): This statistical method models time series data to understand and predict future points. It combines autoregression, differencing, and moving averages to capture patterns in the data.
2. Machine Learning Models:
      * Linear Regression: A basic model that predicts stock prices based on the linear relationship between the dependent variable (stock price) and one or more independent variables (predictors).
      * Decision Trees and Random Forests: These models split the data into branches to make predictions. Random forests, an ensemble method, combine multiple decision trees to improve accuracy.
      * Neural Networks: These models, especially deep learning networks, can capture complex patterns in large datasets. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are particularly useful for time series data.
3. Sentiment Analysis:
      * Natural Language Processing (NLP): Techniques like sentiment analysis analyze text data from news articles, social media, and financial reports to gauge market sentiment. Positive or negative sentiments can influence stock prices.
4. Technical Indicators:
      * Moving Averages: These smooth out price data to identify trends over a specific period.
      * Relative Strength Index (RSI): This momentum oscillator measures the speed and change of price movements, helping to identify overbought or oversold conditions.
      * Bollinger Bands: These volatility bands are plotted above and below a moving average, indicating potential overbought or oversold conditions.

## Challenges and Considerations

  * Market Volatility: Stock prices are influenced by numerous factors, including economic indicators, political events, and investor behavior, making predictions challenging.
  * Data Quality: Accurate predictions require high-quality, up-to-date data. Incomplete or noisy data can lead to incorrect predictions.
  * Model Selection: Choosing the right model is crucial. Simple models might not capture complex patterns, while complex models might overfit the data.


## Applications

  * Investment Strategies: Predictive models can inform buy, hold, or sell decisions.
  * Risk Management: Understanding potential future price movements helps in managing investment risks.
  * Algorithmic Trading: Automated trading systems use predictive models to execute trades based on predefined criteria.
